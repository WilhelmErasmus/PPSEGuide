<h1>Polyphasic Sleeping Experimentation Guide (PPSE)</h1>
<h2>Compiled by Tinytimrob</h2>
<p>PPSE is a polyphasic sleeping experimentation guide which has been compiled for the Polyphasic Sleeping Discord and Subreddit. It serves as a place to write notes on the subject of polyphasic sleeping, and also just sleep in general.
My intention is to provide a clear and easy-to-understand overview of polyphasic sleeping which is accessible to both newcomers and to people with existing experience.
I try to update it regularly with new content and/or to improve clarity. Some content has also been added from other contributors, who I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>Please note that polyphasic sleeping is still highly experimental and the community does not know everything. I have written this guide mostly because of the large volume of misinformation being constantly regurgitated - we get a lot of
people in the Discord or Subreddit who come along with the same old misinformation and it's quite frustrating ;) Hopefully this will help remedy that situation a little.</p>
<p><strong>It is strongly recommended to read through this guide prior to beginning a polyphasic sleep schedule.</strong> I'm well aware it's quite long and you might think this is too much information. But being successful with a polyphasic
sleeping schedule is very difficult and if you're going to go through the pain of the adaptation you might as well be prepared and understand what you're trying to do. Despite being quite long, by reading this guide through properly, you
should gain a good understanding of all of the main polyphasic sleeping concepts, which will likely significantly improve your chances, both at picking a sensible schedule and also at successfully adapting to it.</p>
<p>The following topics are currently covered by this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>What polyphasic sleep is</li>
<li>Pros and cons of polyphasic sleep</li>
<li>Places you can go to get information and help</li>
<li>What the different sleep stages are, and what they do</li>
<li>How sleep cycles work</li>
<li>What the circadian and ultradian rhythms are, and what influence they have on sleep</li>
<li>Advanced sleep mechanics which are relevant to polyphasic sleep, such as sleep pressure and rebound, cycle depth, cycle compression, minimum sleep threshold, interrupted sleep, wake time programming, wake time reduction, second wind and dream memory retention</li>
<li>How various lifestyle considerations might impact your sleep scheduling choices and adaptation chances</li>
<li>What types of schedules exist, how they are named and structured, and why</li>
</ul>
<p>The following topics are currently under construction and will be completed soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to expect from the adaptation period, and how to approach it if you want to have a successful adaptation</li>
<li>Analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) readings to determine sleep stages, along with how to record them</li>
<li>Software written by the community which you can use to help you adapt or record your adaptation</li>
</ul>
<p>The information here is provided freely for everyone to read and make use of. I have chosen to license it under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 because I believe polyphasic sleeping knowledge should be freely accessible to everyone and that charging extortionate amounts
for this knowledge behind a paywall does not serve to help the polyphasic community in the longer term. If you choose to copy or quote from this website I would kindly request that you comply with my wishes and keep this information freely accessible to all.</p>
