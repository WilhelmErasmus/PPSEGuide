<h1>Contributors and Volunteers</h1>
<p>The vast bulk of this guide has been written by me (Tinytimrob) with some minor corrections and additions from various community members. I would specifically like to thank the following people who have contributed their time and knowledge to help run the community, expand understanding of polysleep, build this guide, provide code, and generally just help out to expand others knowledge of polyphasic sleep. I could not have compiled this guide or followed this journey without your help.</p>
