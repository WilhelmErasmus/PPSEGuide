<h1>Everyman</h1>
<p>The everyman family of sleep schedules was originally invented by Puredoxyk and consists of schedules containing a single core complimented with a number of 20-minute naps. Classic scheduling for Everyman takes a standard 5 cycle monophasic core, and then cycles are removed as naps are added. This results in the core cycles plus naps providing 5 cycles of equivalent rest in total.</p>
<p>Each variant of Everyman is numbered based on how many naps it contains. So, for example, an Everyman schedule containing a 3-cycle core will be complimented by 2 naps and this is consequently called "Everyman 2", abbreviated to just E2.</p>
<p><strong>Additional note:</strong> In the past, when the only known viable schedules were Everyman and nap-only, it was common to name the Everyman schedules based on the core length instead of the nap count. This naming convention doesn't work with DC/TC schedules and consequently was dropped in favour of the nap count naming scheme. Some people still prefer to use the old naming scheme, so this should be watched out for. (The conversion is quite easy: 'Everyman 6' is a 6 hour core, which matches up with the modern day Biphasic schedule called Everyman 1; 'Everyman 4.5' is a 4.5 hour core, which matches up with the modern day Everyman 2; 'Everyman 3' is a 3 hour core, identical in name and layout to the modern day Everyman 3, and 'Everyman 1.5' is a 1.5 hour core, which matches up with the modern Everyman 4.)</p>

<h2>Everyman 1 (6 hrs 20 mins)</h2>
<p>This schedule is considered part of the Biphasic family and is covered on the Biphasic scheduling page.</p>

<h2>Everyman 2 (5 hrs 10 mins)</h2>

<p><strong>Adaptation difficulty:</strong> MODERATE</p>
<p><strong>Also known as:</strong> Everyman 4.5</p>
<p>Everyman 2, usually shortened to just E2, has a 3-cycle core and 2 naps. Ideal scheduling is to have the core starting around 11pm, and then follow this up with an early morning nap around 8am and an afternoon nap around 2.30pm. Adding an extra 30 minutes to the core (making it 5h long, and increasing the total sleep time to 5h40m) can optionally allow for extra REM time covering the statistically likely REM period if desired.</p>
<p>If needed, the entire sleep schedule can be rotated by several hours either way without causing significant problems, because the long core allows for good amounts of SWS and REM even if placed quite late. The spacings between naps can also be adjusted slightly without too much damage, although sticking to the stock spacings is largely recommended.</p>

<h2>Everyman 3 (4 hrs)</h2>
<p><a href="https://napchart.com/2b62f"><img src="https://ncimg.tinytimrob.com/2b62f" height=300 /></a></p>
<p><strong>Adaptation difficulty:</strong> HARD</p>
<p>Everyman 3, usually shortened to just E3, has a 2-cycle core and 3 naps. Placing the core earlier is beneficial, because in order to avoid SWS entering the naps the 2-cycle core needs to be largely SWS-focused, with all SWS needs to be consolidated into the first two sleep blocks, and the naps should avoid being placed late in the afternoon. Ideal scheduling is to have the core start around 9pm, and then to place the naps around 4am, 8am and 2.30pm.</p>
<p>Rotating the schedule is quite challenging due to the shorter core time, and will probably require the circadian rhythm to be shifted.</p>
<p>The 4 hour sleep total is on the border of the minimum sleep threshold for some people. Because of the 3 hour core, the E3 schedule does not really favour sleep compression all that well, so people on the border might find this schedule hard to consistently pull off, or they might perpetually feel tired and never quite adapt. Adding an extra 30 minutes to the core (making it 3.5h long, and increasing the total sleep time to 4.5h) can optionally allow for extra REM time covering the statistically likely REM period if desired, and can ease the adaptation for those people who are struggling with a 4 hour sleep total.</p>

<h2>Everyman 4 (2 hrs 50 mins)</h2>
<p><a href="https://napchart.com/jkfzt"><img src="https://ncimg.tinytimrob.com/jkfzt" height=300 /></a></p>
<p><strong>Adaptation difficulty:</strong> VERY HARD</p>
<p><strong>Also known as:</strong> Everyman 1.5</p>
<p>Everyman 4, usually shortened to just E4, has a 1-cycle core and 4 naps.</p>
<p>This is where things start to get very hard indeed, because the total sleep time of 2hrs 50 mins is below the minimum sleep threshold for almost everyone. The single-cycle 90 minute core on this schedule is also not really enough time to get adequate SWS, so people adapting to this schedule are likely to encounter SWS rebounds which make the adaptation period very difficult. The short core and low total sleep time also cause significant sleep cycle compression, potentially down to as far as 60 minutes, which would make the first core 1.5 cycles long and could result in SWS wakes until the schedule has been properly entrained.</p>
<p>In the long term, for people successful on this schedule, the SWS should compress to fill most of the core time and the naps should be largely REM-focused. Some SWS might leak into the earliest or latest naps.</p>
<p>As with Everyman 3, placing the core earlier is beneficial, and it may be even more necessary on this schedule due to the significantly reduced core time allocated for SWS gain. Ideal scheduling is to have the core start around 10pm, and then to place the naps around 3am, 7.30am, and 12pm and 4.30pm. Rotating the schedule requires circadian rhythm to be shifted and adjusting the spacing of the naps by more than 10-15 minutes either way should be avoided.</p>
