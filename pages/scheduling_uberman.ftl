<p><strong>Adaptation difficulty:</strong> INSANELY HARD</p>
<p>The Uberman sleep schedule was invented by Marie Staver (Puredoxyk) and Psuke Bariah in 1999 after reading an artice on Dymaxion sleep in TIME magazine. It consists of six equidistant 20 minute naps (one nap every 4 hours) and NO cores, giving a total of 2 hours of sleep per day.</p>
<p>Uberman is the most famous form of non-biphasic polyphasic sleeping, as well as one of the most popular for beginners to try, most likely due to the huge amount of extra free time it provides. Since its inception, it has been attempted by an increasingly large number of wannabe polyphasers and the schedule itself has an enormous amount of hype. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult schedules of all to succeed with. Due to the insane difficulty of this schedule, almost everyone who tries Uberman drops out before they complete the adaptation process. It is likely that only around 1% of people can be successful with Uberman. It should also be pointed out that <strong>nobody has ever successfully adapted to this schedule without a human alarm clock</strong> and that attempting to adapt to it without a partner to supervise and wake you will <strong>almost definitely result in failure</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite the high difficulty and extremely low success rate, this does not usually stop people from being initially overconfident about their adaptation chances. The initial information source for most beginners tends to be Puredoxyk or the blogs of Steve Pavlina, both of whom have severely understated how difficult the schedule is, along with significantly understating the length of the adaptation period. (The usual claim is that it takes around 1 week to adapt, whereas in reality the adaptation takes anything up to 6 weeks and the schedule doesn't begin to feel good for most until week 4.) But many wannabe Ubermen read these information sources and decide they will be able to tolerate 1 week of sleep dep and succeed. They subsequently create things such as blogs or YouTube channels where they explain how great the schedule will be, only to then fail within the first 10 days. Following on from this failure, they usually go on to make absurd claims like "polyphasic sleep doesn't work" and give up on polyphasic sleeping completely. These sort of botched Uberman attempts really do not do either the Uberman schedule or polyphasic sleeping itself much justice.</p>
